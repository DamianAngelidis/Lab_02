                <p>THis is the About Me of Damian Angelidis, aka the me. If you want to learn about me and see my list of "accomplishments," keep scrolling. You can also go to the blog page to get snapshots of my thoughts and life, as well as my opinion on films, music, politics, and culture in general. For the latter, I do make painstaking effort to make sure they are well thought-out and well-researched. But of course, you most certainly can choose to ignore that and just validate your own beliefs. I also write poems from time to time; they can be viewed on the poetry page. If any of this interests you, feel free to stick around.</p>
