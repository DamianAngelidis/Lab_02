                <h3> General Summary</h3>
                <p>My name is Damian Angelidis. I am 18 years old, and was born in Chicago, but raised in Seattle. I am not Batman, and I hae one "dog" named Beau. I write poetry and scripts, whilst also being filled with angst and enjoying long walks in silence. So prett much your stereotypical tortured artist who's not actually that tortured.</p>
