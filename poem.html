                <p>there is a cemetery filled with sacred possessions<br />
                memories that nightmares fear to awaken<br />
                momentary impulses that desecrated holy lands<br /> 
                <br />
                to cope with existing in this nonsensical world<br />
                i snap chains and let wolves howl; a photo session<br />
                <br />
                i spray heart's ichor on the pyre of pain<br />
                where smoke dances with aurora<br />
                corpses run around in free politic<br />
                exorcised of all humane constraints<br />
                works of shakespeare set ablaze<br />
                <br />
                sacrifice to god within me; monster of my brain<br />
                that consumes fire; drives me away from sagacity<br />
                past and future ousts present, i possess myself<br />
                thousand sensations; iron in ears, bells in mouth<br />
                buried in the graveyard, burning under the pyre<br />
                <br />
                not dead, but on ice with lucifer<br />
                resurrecting life’s punishments<br />
                the taste of her impish smile<br />
                <br />
                my mind sprouts from my head and blooms<br />
                frozen flowers, remnants of drifting psyche<br />
                fuel hell’s furnace; melt me into corruption<br />
                searing remnants of ice, guide to flawed truth<br />
                <br />
                when i awake, a forest in ashes, blind parishioners weep<br />
                next to me, on pristine paper, a single thought<br /></p>

                <br />
                but they promised me i would be protected<br />
                so i rebuilt myself above torn up ground<br />
                and as soon as i laid down foundation<br />
                they strained and smashed to create calamities<br />
                <br />
                volcanoes burn and crush my house<br />
                earthquakes rips my body in half<br />
                tsunamis dowse my hearth, swallow all<br />
                <br />
                i plummet into a deep crevice<br />
                a sun hidden behind rain clouds<br />
                is the last remains of my vision<br />
                before the mantle claims me<br />
                <br />
                like all things in life,<br />
                the rocks will swim into the ocean<br />
                to them, i fade into a distant dream<br />
                <br />
                i remain, rain soaked and dirt smeared<br />
                stuck under the entire weight of earth<br />
                each breath supplying lungs with gravel<br />
                faint outlines are all vision can supply<br />
                the fridgidness masking the loneliness<br />
                last connection to reality, tips of tree roots<br />
                <br />
                how did i not see this coming<br />
                what folly grabbed my mind<br />

                ephemeral orgasms; a heartbeat<br />
                evocation of a completed puzzle <br />
                festering wounds turned baby skin<br />
                my ancient civilization restored<br />
                <br />
                mouth salivating, drool frothing<br /> 
                all that matters is this glimmer<br />
                medicinal herbs for crushed souls<br />
                inebriating drinks for torrid innards<br />

                the next great calamity; mass extinction<br />
                capitals to ghost towns, rainforests to deserts<br />
                all prosperity devoured off the planet<br />
                <br />
                now, i am one with vultures and rats<br />
                scavenging suburbia for giddy euphoria<br />
                diving into dumpsters when footsteps clap<br />
                scrambling back to my windowless box<br />
                
                consumed by all matters of depraved<br />

                endlessly bulldozing garbage heaps into me <br />
                lusting for the next needle, bag, bottle<br />
                
                two chalices, poison and antidote; identical<br />
                highest peaks turned hopeless baselines<br />
                i am chasing bliss to barrel bottom<br /></p>

                <p>i wish the fireflies would stop hitting the sides of the mason jar<br />
                pernicious hysteria, twisted monstrosities<br />
                desperate to burn their impressions in me<br />
                blinking lights; breaking all focus, blocking all progress<br />
                i thought their lives short, but they seem determined to stay <br />
                <br />
                chittering, screaming, blinking, darting<br />
                infesting every corner of my mind<br />
                smearing my thoughts mahogany and crimson<br />
                they slam at my skull when i try to remove them<br />
                twisting and pulling helplessly, the immobile lid<br />
                <br />
                gouge my eyes out, yet i see them<br />
                rip my nose off, yet i smell them<br />
                stab my ears, yet i hear them<br />
                set my skin ablaze, yet i feel them<br />
                sew my mouth shut, yet i taste them<br />

                they are everything<br />
                <br />
                the other bugs, bits of peace providing brief respite<br />
                now litter the bottom of the mason jar as rot<br />
                but the fucking fireflies remain<br />

                red oil spurts everywhere, coating my surroundings<br />
                another avoidable scar, another piece to justify pain within<br />
                <br />
                the landscape close to me is barren; dead trees in blood sand<br />
                reminder of all opportunities to live wasting away<br />
                <br />
                shoes ruined, clothes in tatters<br />
                stomach roars with non-existent hunger<br />
                once, people drove by, begging me to change course<br />
                new clothes, the smallest sip of water<br />
                finally, they just screamed to turn around<br />

                a few months ago, my parents passed<br />

                <br />
                the sun rears from behind clouds smothering it<br />
                it burns my eyes, and i flinch forwards <br />
                infinitesimal second<br />
                <br />
                truths carved in stone becomes puffs of air<br />
